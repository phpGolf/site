# Ideas for a new release

* Use Facebook or Twitter account as only login method
* Use Docker
* Overall goal: Attract more users
* Enable the use of multiple php versions? Some hardcore users might enjoy this, but maybe it will be too much and confusing for newbeginners
* The GUI should be much more intuitive, responsive, simpler and web 2.0 like
* Remove display of top overall golfers? Might be demotivating for new users. Still keep top golfers on individual challenges though
* Reset all submissions after a new release? 
* Still use public challenges?
* Challenges should be easier to solve, but hard to make smaller. 99 Bottles is a perfect example for this
* ASCII art challenges are the least popular ones. These can be removed or made into public challenges
